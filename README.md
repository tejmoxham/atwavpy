
# At-Wavelength Python Toolbox

A python toolbox for processing & simulation of X-ray at-wavelength metrology data. Modelling of optical elements assumes coherent illumination and transmission like elements. A number approximate and direct propgation methods have been implemented assuming coherent sources.

## Installation

A python version later than 3.7 is required, the package can be installed by running the setup python file using the folling command,
```
python setup.py install
```
It is recommended that a new environment is generated and used for the project which can be achieved using the `conda create` command. 

## Usage

Example jupyter noteboooks and data documenting the main features of the package are included in the `/examples/` folder,
 - Simulation of an ideal X-ray KB mirror.
 - Effect of wavefront error on focal profiles.
